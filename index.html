            Tony's Pizza was orignally founded by Tom, who decided that he liked Italian pizza so much,
             and that he couldn't always vist, to make an Italian resturant. <br>
             It was founded in 1968, and has been running ever since.
              We're not sure why it is named Tony's pizza when Tom founded it, bust all well. <br>
            We have been selling Italian pizza, salads, and pasta ever since.
            The current owner is named Eleven, so we think he's in a gang.
